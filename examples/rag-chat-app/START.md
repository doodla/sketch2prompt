# Welcome to RAG Chat App

This blueprint was generated by [Sketch2Prompt](https://github.com/jmassengille/sketch2prompt). Before you begin implementation, let's confirm the setup and configure your environment.

---

## Quick Summary

**Project:** RAG Chat App
**Components:** 4 (1 frontend, 1 backend, 2 storage)
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, Python, React (Vite), Supabase

### Components
- **Web App** (frontend)
- **Backend** (backend)
- **Database** (storage)
- **Vector Store** (storage)

### Key Constraints (from AGENT_PROTOCOL.md)
- **Minimalism First:** Start simple, scale when necessary — no enterprise patterns without explicit request
- **Security Baseline:** Validate inputs at boundaries, never hardcode secrets, structured error logging
- **Modularity:** Functions max 50 lines, files max 300 lines, max 3 nesting levels

## Your Blueprint Files

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `PROJECT_RULES.md` | System constitution, architecture constraints | **Read FIRST** before any implementation |
| `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` | Workflow guidance, code standards, library policy | Read before starting work |
| `specs/*.yaml` | Component specifications with responsibilities | Load **only** the active component |
| `diagram.json` | Re-import into Sketch2Prompt if needed | Only for editing the diagram |

---

## Step 1: Confirm Understanding

Please read `PROJECT_RULES.md` and `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`, then confirm:

1. Does the component structure match your intent?
2. Are the tech stack choices correct?
3. Any constraints you want to adjust?

**Reply with "confirmed" to proceed, or describe what needs adjustment.**

---

## Step 2: IDE Setup

Once confirmed, I'll generate your IDE-specific instruction file.

**Which IDE or AI assistant are you using?**

| Option | Generated File | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code CLI instructions |
| **Cursor** | `.cursorrules` | Cursor AI rules file |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf rules file |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copilot custom instructions |
| **Other/Generic** | `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Universal AI assistant instructions |

**Reply with your IDE choice** (e.g., "Claude Code", "Cursor", etc.)

---

## What Happens Next

After confirmation and IDE selection, I will:

1. **Index** all blueprint files to understand the full system
2. **Generate** your IDE-specific instruction file with:
   - Project-specific rules from `PROJECT_RULES.md`
   - Workflow guidance from `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`
   - Component registry and build order
3. **Create** `STATUS.md` to track implementation progress
4. **Begin** implementation following the build order in `PROJECT_RULES.md`

## IDE Instruction Template

When you confirm your IDE choice, use this template structure to generate the instruction file:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## System Overview
[From PROJECT_RULES.md Section 1]

## Architecture Constraints
[From PROJECT_RULES.md Section 3 - ALWAYS/NEVER/PREFER]

## Code Standards
[From PROJECT_RULES.md Section 4 - stack-specific rules]

## Component Registry
[Table from PROJECT_RULES.md Section 2]

## Build Order
[From PROJECT_RULES.md Section 5]

## Workflow
[From AGENT_PROTOCOL.md - Index → Plan → Implement → Verify]

## Library Policy
[From AGENT_PROTOCOL.md - search before building, minimalism mandate]
```

Adapt formatting to match the specific IDE's conventions.
