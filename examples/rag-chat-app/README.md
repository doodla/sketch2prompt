# Example Blueprint: RAG Chat App

This is a sample blueprint generated by [Sketch2Prompt](https://sketch2prompt.com) showing what a typical export looks like.

## The System

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat application with:
- **React frontend** (Vite + TypeScript)
- **FastAPI backend** (Python)
- **Supabase database** (PostgreSQL)
- **Vector store** for embeddings and semantic search

## Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `START.md` | Bootstrap file - read first, confirms setup |
| `PROJECT_RULES.md` | System constitution and constraints |
| `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` | Workflow guidance for AI assistants |
| `specs/*.yaml` | Component specifications |
| `diagram.json` | Re-import into Sketch2Prompt |

## How to Use

1. Copy these files to your new project root
2. Open `START.md` and follow the confirmation flow
3. Choose your IDE (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.)
4. Let the AI generate your IDE-specific instruction file
5. Start building with clear boundaries and constraints
